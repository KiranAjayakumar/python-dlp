= Geneology of FOL and LP =

A diagram summarizing the geneology of First-order Logic (FOL), Description Logic (DL), and Logic Programming (LP) as a basis for (an) [http://code.google.com/p/python-dlp/wiki/FuXi open-source], [http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/1995/CMU-CS-95-113.pdf enterprise-scale] [EvaluationSemantics4RETE] which outperforms tableau-based algorithms and implements the restricted intersection of Description Logics and Horn Logic ([http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wg/wiki/Core/Positive_Conditions RIF Basic Logic Dialect] @@WORKINPROGRESS): DescriptionLogicPrograms

The diagram is also [http://python-dlp.googlecode.com/files/KR-Geneology.svg available] in its original SVG format

== Notes ==

Cardinality (see: [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/rdfs.html#owl_cardinality_rdf owl:cardinality]) and Disjoint semantics (see: [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/direct.html#owl_disjointWith_semantics DisjointClasses(d1 â€¦ dn)]) cannot be expressed in DLP!:

    "These constructors cannot, in general, be mapped into def-Horn.
    The case of negation is obvious as negation is not allowed in either
    the head or body of a def-Horn rule. As can be seen in Figure 4,
    cardinality restrictions correspond to assertions of variable equality
    and inequality in FOL, and this is again outside of the def-Horn
    framework."

== Concrete EBNF for DLP (via subset of RIF BLD: Positive Conditions) ==
{{{
  CONDITION   ::= CONJUNCTION | DISJUNCTION | EXISTENTIAL | ATOMIC
  CONJUNCTION ::= 'And' '(' CONDITION* ')'
  DISJUNCTION ::= 'Or' '(' CONDITION* ')'
  EXISTENTIAL ::= 'Exists' Var+ '(' CONDITION ')'
  ATOMIC      ::= Uniterm
  Uniterm     ::= Const '(' TERM* ')'
  TERM        ::= Const | Var | Uniterm
  Const       ::= CONSTNAME | '"'CONSTNAME'"''^^'TYPENAME
  Var         ::= '?'VARNAME

  Ruleset  ::= RULE*
  RULE     ::= 'Forall' Var* CLAUSE
  CLAUSE   ::= Implies | ATOMIC
  Implies  ::= ATOMIC ':-' CONDITION
}}}

We can introduce Curies, RDF Literals, and IRI's into CONSTNAME:

{{{
CONSTNAME ::= CURIE | '<' IRI '>' | RDFLiteral
}}}
