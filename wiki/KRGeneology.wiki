= Geneology of FOL and LP =

A diagram summarizing the geneology of First-order Logic (FOL), Description Logic (DL), and Logic Programming (LP) as a basis for (an) [http://code.google.com/p/python-dlp/wiki/FuXi open-source], [http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/1995/CMU-CS-95-113.pdf enterprise-scale] [EvaluationSemantics4RETE] which outperforms tableau-based algorithms.

The diagram is also [http://python-dlp.googlecode.com/files/KR-Geneology.svg available] in its original SVG format

== Notes ==

Cardinality (see: [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/rdfs.html#owl_cardinality_rdf owl:cardinality]) and Disjoint semantics (see: [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/direct.html#owl_disjointWith_semantics DisjointClasses(d1 â€¦ dn)]) cannot be expressed in DLP!:

    "These constructors cannot, in general, be mapped into def-Horn.
    The case of negation is obvious as negation is not allowed in either
    the head or body of a def-Horn rule. As can be seen in Figure 4,
    cardinality restrictions correspond to assertions of variable equality
    and inequality in FOL, and this is again outside of the def-Horn
    framework."

Other restrictions:

    "it is impossible to assert the existence
    of individuals whose identity might not be known."
