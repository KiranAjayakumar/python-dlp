<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

This wiki lists the major points of divergence from rdflib 3.0 beyond just the differences in the new APIs.  It mostly chronicles modifications that were made since [http://code.google.com/p/rdflib/source/detail?r=1658 this] merge from a mercurial maintenance branch used for a [http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/ClevelandClinic/ patient registry].

The source is here _[http://code.google.com/p/python-dlp/source/browse/trunk/#trunk/layercake-python /trunk/layercake-python/]_

= Details =

  * Various fixes to the in-memory, [http://www.ivan-herman.net/Misc/2010/sparqlDesc.html sparql-p] based SPARQL algebra implementation
  * Various fixes to [http://chimezie.posterous.com/a-complete-translation-from-sparql-into-effic SPARQL-to-SQL] implementation (including significant performance enhancements)
    *  Support for told BNode queries (queries with BNodes having explicit labels - _:a are matched by name)
    * ASK query fixes
  * Completely removed old C parser (so it is 100% Python again)

= Additional SPARQL Layers  =

New *sparql_query* method on all Store instances and a default that is a 'native' SPARQL implementation based on sparql-p's expansion trees layered on top of the read-only RDF APIs of the underlying store 

= Generic SPARQL Store =

Added rdflib.store.SPARQL store which is an implementation of the readonly subset of the APIs to use SPARQL against a remote endpoint.  Augments Ivan Herman's [http://ivan-herman.name/2007/07/06/sparql-endpoint-interface-to-python/ SPARQL Endpoint interface to Python] in the following ways:
  * Support for namespace binding
  * Replaced 'native' Python XML DOM api with 4Suite-XML Domlette 
  *  Incorporated as an rdflib store

= GRDDL Implementation with Amara =

It also [http://code.google.com/p/python-dlp/source/browse/trunk/layercake-python/rdflib_tools/GRDDLAmara.py includes] an updated version of GRDDL.py ported to work with [http://xml3k.org/Amara2 Amara 2] (the successor to 4Suite XML).

= Command-line scripts =

There are several command-line scripts installed along with this package and are described briefly after the list below:
  * rdfpipe
  * mysql-rdfload
  * dataset-description
  * sparqler

== rdfpipe Command-line Script ==
