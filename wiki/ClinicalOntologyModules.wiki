#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This is the implementation used for the Segmenting and Merging Domain-specific Ontology Modules for Clinical Informatics [http://copia.posterous.com/segmenting-and-merging-domain-specific-ontolo method]. 

= Source =

See [http://code.google.com/p/python-dlp/source/browse/trunk/clinical-ontology-modules source code] in subversion


= Installation =

== Software Dependencies ==

The following Python libraries are needed to use this module

  * [http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/ FuXi] (Uses its [http://code.google.com/p/fuxi/wiki/InfixOwl OWL API] for creating and manipulating OWL/RDF graphs)
  * Either rdflib 2.4.+ or [http://code.google.com/p/python-dlp/wiki/LayerCakePythonDivergence layercake-python] (needed by FuXi! and used for managing / parsing / serializing OWL RDF graphs)
  * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/ MySQLdb] (Used to persist SNOMED-CT distribution files)
  * MySQL server and client (5.1 preferred)

== Loading SNOMED-CT ==

Below are step-by-step instructions for loading in a SNOMED-CT distribution into a MySQL database using this library.  The last release this has been tested on is the distribution released on January 31st 2010.

First, we need to create a MySQL database (we will call it _snomed_distro_, but any valid database name will suffice)

{{{
$ mysql -u ..user.. -p
Enter password: 
Server version: 5.1.29-rc MySQL Community Server (GPL)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> create database snomed_distro;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> 
}}}



= Command-line Options =

{{{
Usage: ManageSNOMED-CT.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --root=ROOT           Determines the termination point for the extraction
                        algorithm (either stop at the closest primitive
                        concept going upwards or at the very top of the SNOMED
                        taxonomy).  Respectively the value of this option can
                        be one of "primitive" or "root" (the default)
  --load                Load SNOMED-CT distribution files (in the current
                        directory) into a MySQL DB
  --verbose             Output debug print statements or not
  -e EXTRACT, --extract=EXTRACT
                        Extract an OWL representation from SNOMED-CT using the
                        comma-separated list of SNOMED-CT identifiers as the
                        starting point
  --snomedCore          Extract an OWL representation from SNOMED-CT using the
                        concepts with human readable definitions as the
                        starting point
  --extractFile=EXTRACTFILE
                        Same as --extract, except the comma-separated list of
                        SNOMED-CT identifiers are in the specified file
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        The name of the file to write out the OWL/RDF to
                        (STDOUT is used otherwise
  -n NORMALFORM, --normalForm=NORMALFORM
                        Whether to extract using the long normal form (long),
                        short normal form (short), or neither (- the default
                        -)
  -l LOCATION, --location=LOCATION
                        The directory where the delimited files or SNOMED-CT
                        -> FMA mappings will be loaded from (the default is
                        the current directory)
  -s SERVER, --server=SERVER
                        Host name of the MySQL database to connect to
  -f FILES, --files=FILES
                        A comma-separated list of distribution files to load
                        from in the order: concept, descriptions,
                        relationship, definition
  -p PORT, --port=PORT  The port to use when connecting to the MySQL database
  -w PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
                        Password
  -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
                        User name to use when connecting to the MySQL database
  -d DATABASE, --database=DATABASE
                        The name of the MySQL database to connect to
  --profile             Enable profiling statistics
